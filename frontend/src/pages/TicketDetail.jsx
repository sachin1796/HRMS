              description="For the past week, my laptop has been experiencing intermittent freezing issues. The freezes occur randomly, approximately 3-4 times a day, and last about 30-40 seconds each time. During these freezes, the cursor becomes unresponsive, and I am unable to click on anything or use keyboard shortcuts. The issue usually resolves itself, but it significantly disrupts my work.

I first noticed the problem on February 1, 2024, while using Google Meet for a video conference. Since then, the issue has occurred during various tasks, including browsing with Chrome, using Microsoft Office applications, and even when the laptop is idle.

Error messages: No specific error messages have appeared, but the Task Manager (when accessible) shows a spike in CPU usage to 100% during these freezes."
